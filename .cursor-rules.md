# Cursor Project Rules: SQL Runner

## Architecture & Design
- Jobs are described in YAML, with a single SQL template and batch parameters.
- Batches are not described individually; each batch is a repeatable unit with parameterized SQL (using placeholders like {{start}}, {{end}}, etc.).
- SQL templates live in `sql/`, job configs in `jobs/`.
- The CLI uses `commander`, `chalk` (v4), and `ora` (v5) for UX and feedback.
- Database connection is managed via `pg` and configured with `.env` (DB_CONNECTION_STRING).

## Batch Execution
- Each batch executes the same SQL with different parameters (start, end, and job-level params).
- Batch size should default to 10,000â€“20,000 for safety; 50,000 is aggressive and should be tested/monitored.
- SQL templates must cast to `numeric` for `ROUND(..., 2)` to avoid Postgres errors.

## Implementation Notes
- Use template placeholders in SQL for all batch and job parameters.
- Each batch is committed as a transaction for safety and performance.
- Use `generate_series` for efficient bulk inserts in Postgres.
- Monitor DB performance and adjust batch size as needed.
